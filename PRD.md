Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name: YouTube Chapter Generator Extension
Version: 1.0
Date: 28/3/2025

1. Introduction
   1.1 Purpose
   This document outlines the requirements for a Chrome extension designed to enhance the YouTube viewing experience by leveraging OpenAI's GPT to automatically generate chapters for videos. The extension will provide users with a list of chapters accompanied by timestamps, enabling easy navigation to specific sections of a video.
   1.2 Scope
   The Chrome extension will:
   Extract video transcripts or metadata from YouTube videos.

Send this data to a server-side component that interacts with the OpenAI API.

Use GPT to analyze the content and generate a structured list of chapters with timestamps.

Inject these chapters into the YouTube page for seamless user navigation.

1.3 Target Audience
YouTube viewers who consume long-form content such as tutorials, lectures, or podcasts.

Content creators seeking to improve viewer experience by offering chapter navigation.

Users desiring a more structured and efficient way to watch videos.

2. Functional Requirements
   2.1 Chrome Extension Interface
   Installation: Available for download and installation via the Chrome Web Store.

Toolbar Integration: Adds an icon to the Chrome toolbar that activates the chapter generation process when clicked on a YouTube video page.

User Feedback: Displays a loading indicator during chapter generation to keep the user informed.

Chapter Presentation: Shows generated chapters as a clickable list with timestamps, allowing users to jump to specific video segments.

2.2 Data Extraction
Video Identification: Extracts the video ID from the YouTube URL to identify the content.

Transcript Retrieval:
Attempts to obtain the video transcript (text and timestamps) via YouTube’s API or webpage parsing.

For videos lacking transcripts, collects metadata such as the title and description.

Fallback Handling: If no transcript is available, either notifies the user or uses metadata to attempt chapter generation.

2.3 Server-Side Component
Request Processing: Accepts data (transcript or metadata) sent from the extension.

Authentication: Secures requests with authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use.

API Interaction:
Forwards the data to the OpenAI API with a tailored prompt.

Parses the GPT response to extract chapter titles and timestamps.

Response Delivery: Returns the generated chapter list to the extension.

2.4 GPT Integration
Prompt Design:
Constructs prompts directing GPT to analyze the transcript or metadata and produce concise chapter titles with timestamps.

Specifies a structured output format (e.g., "Chapter Title - MM:SS").

Language Handling: Supports English initially, with potential expansion to other languages in future versions.

2.5 Chapter Injection
DOM Integration:
Inserts the chapter list into the YouTube page’s DOM, such as below the video player or in the description section.

Styles the list to align with YouTube’s visual design for a cohesive look.

Navigation Functionality: Attaches event listeners to each chapter, enabling users to click and jump to the corresponding timestamp.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
   3.1 Performance
   Speed: Aims to complete chapter generation within 10 seconds for typical videos (10-30 minutes).

Resource Usage: Ensures minimal impact on browser performance during operation.

3.2 Security
API Security: Manages OpenAI API keys securely on the server-side, avoiding client-side exposure.

Data Transmission: Encrypts communication between the extension and server using HTTPS.

Privacy: Avoids collecting or storing unnecessary user data, adhering to privacy regulations.

3.3 Usability
Ease of Use: Requires minimal user interaction—just a single click to generate chapters.

Clarity: Provides intuitive feedback, such as loading indicators and error messages.

3.4 Compatibility
Browser: Fully compatible with the latest Chrome versions.

YouTube: Supports various YouTube video types and durations.

Edge Cases: Gracefully handles scenarios like missing transcripts or short videos.

3.5 Scalability
Request Handling: Server-side component supports multiple simultaneous requests.

API Efficiency: Optimizes OpenAI API calls to manage costs and respect rate limits.

4. Technical Requirements
   4.1 Chrome Extension
   Technologies: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

APIs: Utilizes Chrome Extension APIs for browser interaction and content scripts for DOM manipulation.

Communication: Sends HTTP requests to the server-side component.

4.2 Server-Side Component
Framework Options: Built with Node.js (Express) or Python (Flask).

Security: Incorporates authentication (e.g., JWT) for request validation.

Hosting: Deployed on a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku.

4.3 OpenAI API
Model Selection: Uses GPT-4 or others based on availability and performance needs.

Prompt Refinement: Requires testing to optimize chapter generation accuracy.

4.4 Data Storage
Caching: Optionally caches generated chapters for quick retrieval of repeated requests.

Database: Employs a secure database (e.g., MongoDB) if caching is implemented.

5. User Journey
   Installation: User adds the extension from the Chrome Web Store.

Activation: On a YouTube video page, the user clicks the toolbar icon.

Data Extraction: The extension retrieves the transcript or metadata and sends it to the server.

Chapter Generation: The server uses GPT to create chapters and returns them to the extension.

Display: Chapters appear on the YouTube page as a navigable list.

Navigation: User clicks a chapter to jump to that section of the video.

6. Edge Cases and Considerations
   No Transcript Available: Notifies the user or attempts metadata-based chapter generation.

Short Videos: Applies a minimum length threshold (e.g., 5 minutes) for chapter generation.

Non-English Content: Focuses on English initially; future updates may add translation or multi-language support.

Live Streams: Disables the feature or adapts for real-time limitations.

Privacy Compliance: Ensures secure data handling with no unnecessary retention.

7. Development and Testing
   7.1 Development Phases
   Phase 1: Create the Chrome extension interface and core functionality.

Phase 2: Build the server-side component with secure API integration.

Phase 3: Refine GPT prompts for accurate chapter output.

Phase 4: Implement DOM injection and navigation features.

7.2 Testing
Unit Tests: Validate individual components (extension, server functions).

Integration Tests: Confirm smooth extension-server interaction.

User Testing: Assess usability and chapter quality with real users.

Performance Tests: Evaluate performance across different video lengths.

8. Deployment
   Extension: Released on the Chrome Web Store.

Server: Hosted on a scalable cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

Monitoring: Tracks usage, performance, and errors post-launch.

9. Future Enhancements
   Language Expansion: Support for non-English transcripts.

User Customization: Options to adjust chapter count or style.

Analytics: Insights into chapter usage patterns.

Platform Growth: Potential extension to other video platforms (e.g., Vimeo).
